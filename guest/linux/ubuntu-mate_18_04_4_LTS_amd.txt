"You are using ACS override. Don’t do that.

The reason the driver crashes is because it’s not true pcie isolation and the drivers are seeing something… somewhere… and causing an issue.

Thems the breaks when using ACS override. Sometimes it’s k. Sometimes not.

Kernel CLI should be intel_iommu=on iommu=1

Nothing about ACS. Does your board require ACS? If so try physically re arranging your cards. Your symptom is exactly what I ran into on Ryzen before agesa 1006. ACS was no hope there because “one big group”"
