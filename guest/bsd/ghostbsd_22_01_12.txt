Resolution changed from 800x600   :)
NOTE: I was not able to change resolution for Qemu-KVM 'qxl' vga card.
      Also when I was using real card 'Radeon RX 570' or 'GeForce GTX 1050'.
      I could not change the resolution.

Only "scfb" driver works when qemu 'qxl' vga card is used.
I had to change qemu vga card to 'vmware'.
And use 'xf86-video-vmware' driver in the bsd.

Install driver "vmware"
 $ pkg search xf86-video-vmware
 $ sudo pkg install xf86-video-vmware

Here is xorg.conf sample file:
  "xorg_bsd_sample.conf"
  [ https://gist.github.com/lordmikefin/34cf6ad048b0f733308f3404b9ef8cc4 ]

 $ sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Just copy-paste lines from the sample :)
